PHYS 2200 Fall 2019 "fill in the blanks" code
Approximates the integral for the Fourier transform by first using the "rectangle method"
then using the "trapazoid method" and comparing results via plot to the exact function.
Meant to be open with Andaconda Navigator's Jupyter Notebook(.ipynb)

The Fourier transform (FT) decomposes a function of time (a signal) into its constituent frequencies.
This is similar to the way a musical chord can be expressed in terms of the volumes and frequencies
of its constituent notes. Used in digital audio.
